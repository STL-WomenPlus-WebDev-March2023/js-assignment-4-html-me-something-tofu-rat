         <p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my site! 
            My name is Moe, and I have had a fascination with ocean life for as long as I can remember.
            Here is a curated list of some of my favorite creatures you can find in the ocean~

         <h2> Mola Mola </h2>
      <p>The Mola Mola is an odd fish, to say the least. Often found floating lazily at the surface in open ocean water, these are some of the world's largest bony fish.
         While we commonly refer to this fish as an ocean sunfish in English, other languages have more creative names. In Polish, they are called "samogłów", which means "only head", or "head alone". 
         My personal favorite is the Russian name,  "рыба-луна", which translates to "moon fish".

         <h2> Orcas </h2>
      <p>Orcas have been popping up a lot in the news lately. Despite a lot of bad press, these guys remain one of my all time favorite animals. 
         The term "killer whale" comes from a mistranlastion of the orignal Spanish name which translates to "whale killer"- a more accurate description as orcas are known to hunt whale species. 
         Many know that orcas are the largest members of the dolphin family, but they are also whales. While all dolphins are whales, not all whales are dolphins. All species are related and fall under the order "Cetacea".
         All things considered, these animals are incredibly intelligent and downright frightening at times. Their black and white faces remind me of corpse paint- to me, they are the most metal animals in the sea.

         <h2> Cyerce Elegans </h2>
      <p> Little is known about the lives of this species, so there is little to report on here. 
         What is obvious, is that these ethereal creatures look like they came straight out of a sci-fi movie. 
         Truly, few creatures can compete with Cyerce Elegans beauty.
